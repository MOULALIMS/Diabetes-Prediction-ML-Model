# Diabetes-Prediction-ML-Model

This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes in patients based on various health parameters using machine learning techniques. Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide, and early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project seeks to create a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at high risk of developing diabetes.


Data

The dataset used for this project contains several health-related features such as max_glu serum,Insulin and others, collected from individuals who have undergone medical examinations. Each record in the dataset is labeled with a binary outcome indicating whether the individual has diabetes or not.


Methodology

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and address any data inconsistencies.
Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected to train the machine learning model, ensuring that only the most informative attributes are considered.
Model Training: Several machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting are trained on the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a held-out test set. Cross-validation techniques may also be employed to assess generalization performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters of the best-performing models are fine-tuned to optimize performance further.
Model Deployment: Once the best model is selected, it can be deployed in a real-world setting where it can predict the likelihood of diabetes for new patients based on their health parameters.


Results

The performance of the machine learning models is assessed based on their ability to accurately predict diabetes onset. The final model achieves high accuracy and other relevant evaluation metrics, demonstrating its potential for real-world application.


Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting diabetes onset based on health parameters. The developed model can be valuable for healthcare providers in identifying individuals at risk of diabetes early, allowing for timely intervention and improved patient care.
